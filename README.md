**Some of my code use the ACM template to deal the IO and some just write the function,so if you have any better template to deal with the IOsrtream,just give me an issue**

**In my code, you can ses the instruction of the problem and after that is my idea to solve the problem,most of them are writing by Chinese,sometimes I would like to use English to explain my idea,so if you find there are some mistakes in my explaination, just forgive me, I will try my best to improve my speaking and writing**

**The Arithmetic is about some interesting arithmetic problem,and other directories just as their name. I use the number of the problem on Leetcode Website to name my gofile, so you can verify my code easily. I can not ensure that every code have the best Time complexity, if you have any better solution, weicome to communicate with me by the issue, I will be very appreciate by that**
